### Market Data (MD) ###

1. Instrument Downloader: This component is responsible for downloading instrument specifications provided by the exchange. These specifications are crucial for various operations, including trading, backtesting, subscription management, and internal data mapping.

2. Market Data Live Process:
   For this specific use case, we consider the Option Chain Snapshot as our primary market data. Ideally, market data can be more granular, such as raw packets or even order book snapshots, which may be provided directly by the exchange or broker.

   The Option Chain Snapshot is generated by subscribing to individual instruments (calls, puts, and the underlying future/index) via WebSockets. These individual data streams are then stitched together to form a live Option Chain table.

   This Option Chain table is subsequently published to Redis at regular intervals, making it available for consumption by various clients. These clients may include:

   a) The Market Data Dumper: This client is essential for capturing a full day's option chain data at regular intervals, which is then used for replaying market scenarios or backtesting strategies.

   b) Strategy or Main Trading Bot: Located in the scale_bot directory, this client utilizes the live option chain for executing trading strategies.

   c) Tools for Viewing the Option Chain: These are applications designed to display and analyze the option chain data.
